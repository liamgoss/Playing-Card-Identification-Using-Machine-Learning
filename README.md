# Playing Card Identification Using Machine Learning
 
This project uses PCA (Principle Component Analysis) and SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to identify playing cards using machine learning. This project is created by Liam Goss and Eric Rivera for our ECE 172 Machine Learning mid-semester project.
